## 4.2 Basic Layout - Flex

If you have experience in flexbox layout, you can skip this chapter. But attention that if you want to support iOS before iOS8, you need to enable style auto completion at "project（项目）”-> "project settings（项目设置）" -> "auto style completion at uploading（上传代码时样式自动补全）".

![Figure 4-2 auto style completion in dev tools](/static/4-2.png)

In mini programs, adaption for different devices of different screen sizes must be considered. In web we use Box Model, `display:inline | block | inline-block, position, float` are used to do the layout, but not flexible enought to create some special layouts, such as following list which requirs vertically middle-aligned with uncertain height.

![Figure 4-3 a common list layout](/static/4-3.png)
*Figure 4-3 a common list layout*

For this case flex is a better option.

Before we begin, we need some word conventions. From now on, "Container" menas elements that uses flex layout, class name "container" is used in code examples, elements in container is called "items", class name "item" is attached.

### 4.2.1 basic concepts

The concept of flex is first proposed in 2009, its purpose is to provide a more flexible layout model, to enable conainer to best layout items according to their dimensions and order, this makes adaption easier.

In the above exmaple, we could acheive vertically middle alignment by setting following 2 attributes:

```css
.container{
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

Flex is not ONE property, it is a set of new rules. Some rules are for containers and some for items.

For containers there are:
```css
display:flex;

flex-direction:row（default） | row-reverse | column |column-reverse

flex-wrap:nowrap（default） | wrap | wrap-reverse

justify-content:flex-start（default） | flex-end | center |space-between | space-around | space-evenly

align-items:stretch（default） | center  | flex-end | baseline | flex-start

align-content:stretch（default） | flex-start | center |flex-end | space-between | space-around | space-evenly
```

For items there are:
```css
order:0（default） | &lt;integer&gt;

flex-shrink:1（default） | &lt;number&gt;

flex-grow:0（default） | &lt;number&gt;

flex-basis:auto（default） | &lt;length&gt;

flex:none | auto | @flex-grow @flex-shrink @flex-basis

align-self:auto（default） | flex-start | flex-end |center | baseline| stretch
```

Before diving into each property, a coordinate system is needed. To default, horionztal direction is main axis, vertical one is cross axis.

![Figure 4-5 default main axis and cross axis](/static/4-5.png)
*Figure 4-5 default main axis and cross axis*

Items are aligned on main axis and newlines are created on cross axis. Cross axis is vertical to main axis.

![Figure 4-6 item alignment](/static/4-6.png)
*Figure 4-6 item alignment*

The examples listed from here are the default cordinate system.

### 4.2.2 Container Properties

These properties are to manage item layout in container, including alignment and order.

**flex-direction**

Set order by setting main axis.
```css
.container{
  flex-direction: row（default） | row-reverse | column  | column-reverse
}
```

row(default): main axis is to the right. 

row-reverse: main axis is to the left. 

column: main axis is from top to bottom.

column-reverse: maxis is from bottom to top.

![Figure 4-7 flex-direction](/static/4-7.png)
*Figure 4-7 flex-direction*

**flex-wrap**

This enables/disables newlines in item alignment, and the direction when newlines are added.

```css
.container{
  flex-wrap: nowrap（default） | wrap | wrap-reverse
}
```

nowrap(default): no newlines, too many items will overflow
wrap: newlines are added if items cannot be put in one line
wrap-reverse: same as wrap, but newlines's direction is the reversed.

![Figure 4-8 flex-wrap](/static/4-8.png)
*Figure 4-8 flex-wrap*

**justify-content**
This determines the alignment on main axis, and the space around items.

```css
.container{
  justify-content: flex-start（default） | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around| space-evenly
}
```

`flex-start` (default): items start at main axis origin, no spaces between items
`center`: items placed at the center, no spaces between items. The distane to the left and right border are the same
`flex-end`: items placed at the end of main axis, no spaces between items
`space-between`: spaces between items are equal, no spaces to the left and right border
`space-around`: similar to `space-beween`, but the distance to left or right border is half of spaces between two items
`space-evently`: spaces between items and the borders are the same.

![Figure 4-9 justify-content](/static/4-9.png)
*Figure 4-9 justify-content*

**align-items**
This determine item alignment in the height of one line
```css
.container{
  align-items:stretch（默认值） | flex-start | center | flex-end | baseline
}
```

stretch(default): items will be stretched to full line height
flex-start: top border of items are to the container border
center: aligned at the center line
flex-end: bottom border of items are to the container bottom
baseline: aligned at the line basline


![Figure 4-10 align-items](/static/4-7.png)
*Figure 4-10 align-items*

**align-content**
If multiple lines, this set the alignment on cross axis, and how the spaces are placed.

```css
.container{
  align-content: stretch(defult) | flex-start | center | flex-end | space-between |space-around | space-evenly
}
```

stretch(default): if not set item size, items are streched to fill the cross axis. When item size is set, lines are stretched to fill.
flex-start: first line meets top border of container, no space between lines.
center: lines are placed in the middle, no space between lines.
flex-end: last line meets bottom border, no space between lines
space-between: spaces between lines are the same, no space to the top and bottom border
space-around: spaces between lines are the same, space to the top or bottom border is half of space between lines
space-evenly: all space between items or top/bottom borders are the same

### 4.2.3 Item properties
Item properties are to set dimension, position and alignment to items.

**order**

It is to set order of items on main axis, smaller gets more front. Order is integer.

```css
.item{
  order: 0（default） | <integer>
}
```

![4-12 order](/static/4-12.png)
*Figure 4-12 order*

**flex-shrink**

When items overflow on main axis, `flex-shrink` could be used to compress items to adapt. Its value should be non-negative.

```css
.item{
  flex-shrink: 1（default） | <number>
}

.item1{
  width: 120px;
  flex-shrink: 2;
}

.item2{
  width: 150px;
  flex-shrink: 3;
}

.item3{ // flex-shrink is to 1
  width: 180px;
}
```

To make it simpler to understand, suppose we have a container of 400px width, three items in it each have width of: 120px, 150px, 180px, then set `flex-shrink` of item 1 and item 2 to `2` and `3`.

```css
.container{
  display: flex;
  width: 400px; // container width is 400px
}
```

In above example, `400 - (120 + 150 + 180) = -50px` so items overflows, when calculating how to shrink them, weight on each item is `flex-shrink` multiplied by width, totally `120 2 + 150 3+ 180 * 1 = 870`. The new width of each item is divided according to the share of weights.

width of item1：120 - 50 * 120 * 2 / 870 ≈ 106px

width of item2：150 - 50 * 150 * 3 / 870 ≈ 124px

width of item3：180 - 50 * 180 * 1 / 870 ≈ 169px

Width is rounded down if decimal part exists.

![Figure 4-13 flex-shrink](/static/4-13.png)
*Figure 4-14 flex-shrink*

Attention that if sum of all flex-shrinks is smaller than 1, things change. Total weight is `120*0.1 + 150*0.2 + 180*0.3 = 96`, the overflowing space is `50 * (0.1 + 0.2 + 0.3) / 1 = 30px`.

width of item1：120 - 30 * 120 * 0.1 / 96 = 116px

width of item2：150 - 30 * 150 * 0.2 / 96 = 140px

width of item3：180 - 30 * 180 * 0.3 / 96 = 163px

**flex-grow**

When there are spaces in the main axis, flex-grow could be use to allocate the space. It should be non-negative.

```css
.item{
  flex-grow: 0（default） | <number>
}
```

Say we have a 400px width container, items in it have widths of : 80px, 120px, 140px, set flex-grow of item1 and item2 to `3` and `1`.

```css
.container{

  display: flex;

  width: 400px; // 容器宽度为400px

}

.item1{
  width: 80px;
  flex-grow: 3;
}

.item2{
  width: 120px;
  flex-grow: 1;
}

.item3{ // flex-grow is default to 0
  width: 140px;
}
```
In above example, space left is `400 - (80 + 120 + 140) = 60px`, so the new widths should be:

width of item1: 80 + 60 * 3 / (3 + 1 + 0) =125px

width of item2: 120 +  60 * 1 / (3 + 1 + 0) =135px

width of item3: 140 +  60 * 0 / (3 + 1 + 0) =140px

![Figure 4-14 flex-grow](/static/4-14.png)
*Figure 4-14 flex-grow*

Attention that if sum of all flex-grows is smaller than 1, it will be considered as 1, if we modify the example:

```css
.container{
  display: flex;
  width: 400px; // container width
}

.item1{
  width: 50px;
  flex-grow: 0.1;
}

.item2{
  width: 80px;
  flex-grow: 0.3;
}

.item3{
  width: 110px;
  flex-grow: 0.2;
}
```

In the above example, rest space is `400 - (50 + 80 + 110) = 160px`. Since flex-grow addes up to 0.1 + 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.6 < 1, rest space is divided by `160 / 1 = 160px`:

width of item1: `50 + 160 * 0.1 = 66px`

width of item2: 80 + 160 * 0.3 = 128px

width of item3: 110 + 160 * 0.2 = 142px


**flex-basis**

When container's flex-direction is `row` or `row-reverse`, and `width` is also set, `flex-basis` has higher priority than `width`, which means `flex-basis` is used instead of `width`.

When flex-direction is `column` or `column-reverse` and `height` is also set, `flex-basis` has higher priority than `height`, which means `flex-basis` is used instead of `height`.

But non-auto one has higher priority for `flex-basis` and `width`( or `height`).

```css
.item{
  flex-basis: auto（default） | <number>px
}
```

![Figure 4-15 flex-basis](/static/4-15.png)
*Figure 4-15 flex-basis*

**flex**

Flex is a shorthand for `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink` and `flex-basis`, default to `none` which equals to `00 auto`. If set to `auto`, it is the same as `1 1 auto`.

```css
.item{
  flex: none | auto | @flex-grow @flex-shrink@flex-basis
}
```

**align-self**

It is used to set alignment on cross axis, and override `align-items` of container. This could set special alignments, it is default to `auto`, inherit the `align-items` of container, if `align-items` is not set, `stretch` is used.

```css
.item{
  align-self: auto（default） | flex-start | center | flex-end | baseline |stretch
}
```
