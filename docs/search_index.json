WeChat already started to offer JS APIs in its WebView since long ago when it became a more and more role in mobile web.\nSome developers may find this familiar:\ncode snippet 1-1: Preview images with WeixinJSBridge\nWeixinJSBridge.invoke('imagePreview', {\n    current: 'http://inews.gtimg.com/newsapp_bt/0/1693121381/641',\n    urls: [ // All image URLs in an array\n        'https://img1.gtimg.com/10/1048/104857/10485731_980x1200_0.jpg',\n        'https://img1.gtimg.com/10/1048/104857/10485726_980x1200_0.jpg',\n        'https://img1.gtimg.com/10/1048/104857/10485729_980x1200_0.jpg'\n    ]\n}, function(res) {\n    console.log(res.err_msg)\n})\n\nThis is a JS API to trigger native WeChat image previewer. It is obviously simpler and more performant than using some JS libraries based on DOM.\nAs a matter of fact, WeChat didn't first announce the existence of these APIs, because they were for internal use. Many developers outside of WeChat found them and started to use them in a similar fashion. As more and more developers acknowledged,  it became the de facto standard in WeChat's WebView. \nIn early 2015, WeChat released the JS-SDK, which contains lots of APIs for Camera, Voice Recording, Voice Recognition, QR code, Map, Pay and Sharing .etc. These APIs enables all developers to use native power from WeChat App to accomplish things that couldn't be done before.\nThis is also a snippet to preview images, but with JS-SDK:\ncode snippet 1-2: Preview images with JS-SDK\nwx.previewImage({\n  current: 'https://img1.gtimg.com/10/1048/104857/10485726_980x1200_0.jpg',\n  urls: [ // 所有图片的URL列表，数组格式\n    'https://img1.gtimg.com/10/1048/104857/10485731_980x1200_0.jpg',\n    'https://img1.gtimg.com/10/1048/104857/10485726_980x1200_0.jpg',\n    'https://img1.gtimg.com/10/1048/104857/10485729_980x1200_0.jpg'\n  ],\n  success: function(res) {\n    console.log(res)\n  }\n})\n\nJS-SDK is a wrapper for WeixinJSBrige, with new abilities. From usage data, most of web pages shared in WeChat uses JS-SDK, which means a lot of attention.\nJS-SDK extends mobile web pages with APIs exposed from Native App, but still it doesn't solve the problem of bad user experience.\nWhen a new web page is opened, there is a white blank moment before it is fully loaded and rendered. This becomes more significant in mobile devices because of the lower device spec and poor network. Our team put a lot of efforts to help developers overcome this problem, and the result is \"JS-SDK enhanced version\". One of the enhanced features is \"WeChat Offline Storage\".\nFollowing is from internal document(which is not public):\n\nWeChat Offline Storage is a solution for acceleration in WeChat.\nWith Offline Storage,  web developers can access local resources rather than fetching it from remote servers, which cut down the loading time and generate faster experience. Every Official Account has up to 5M storage quota for all of its web apps.\n\nThis storage is similar to HTML5 Application Cache, but it fixes its problems.\nDuring our internal test, we found that offline storage indeed helps for some of the problems, but still doesn't completely solve \"white screen problem\" mentioned above. For a case like when the web page users lots of external CSS or JS resources,  UI thread will be taken up and the web page will be still \"white\" for some time. And handling the resources' cache is very complicated, developers' skill is required.\nBesides white screen, another problem is \"slow response to user interaction\", which could be mainly categorized to \"janky page transitions\" and \"latency in finger taps\".\nFor experienced developers, SPA frameworks could be used to mimic smooth page transitions from Native Apps. The usual way of doing it is creating multiple pages in one WebView and using CSS for the smooth animation. With elaborated techniques both in CSS and JS, the above two problem can be solved to some extent, but not all developer have the time and resources to accomplish that.\nThe problem WeChat faces is to find a solution that enables all developers to create apps with good experience. This just cannot be solved with just a JS-SDK, a whole new system is required to make following possible:\n\nfaster Loading\nmore abilities\nnative-like experience\nsimple & safe access to WeChat's data\nsimple to develop\n\nAnd this system is Mini Program.\n"},"chapter-1/1.1.2 Difference between Mini Program and Web App.html":{"url":"chapter-1/1.1.2 Difference between Mini Program and Web App.html","title":"1.1.2 Difference between Mini Program and Web App","keywords":"","body":"1.1.2 Difference between Mini Program and Web App\nMini programs are developed by JavaScript, so it is often compared to web app. They are similar in many ways, for Front-End Developers, it is very easy to start a mini program. But there are some differences between them.\nIn a common web browser, there is only one Main Thread, so the page may freeze after running JavaScript for a long time. But in Mini Program, UI rendering and JavaScript are separated in different Process. Developers can use various DOM API exposed by browser, but not from mini program. In mini program, JavaScript is run in JSCore, which is not a browser environment, many popular libraries like jQuery, Zepto .etc couldn't be used. JSCore is also different from Node.js, some of the NPM modules couldn't work also.\nWeb Apps run on many different browsers.

Lifecycle and Opening Scene\nThe first time mini program is opend, WeChat Native prepares the host environment, get mini program code package from remote or cache and injects them into host environment, when everything is initialized, WeChat will call onLaunch() of App instance.\nMini Program could be closed by tapping the close button at top right,\nor switched to backgrounde mode by tapping Homde button, but in either cases mini programs are not terminated. onHide() will be called.\nWhen mini program is opend again, WeChat Native will activate the instance at background, and set it to foreground, and onShow() will be called.\nWe can see that lifecycle hooks are called automatically by WeChat App's response to user interactions. To avoid confusions in program, we shouldn't call lifecycle hooks manually. \nThere are many scenes of mini program being opened, it maybe opened in groupd chat, in mini program list, from QR code scanning or event from another mini program. For the needs to different logic according to different opening scenes, onLaunch() and onShow() will be attached with these information as paramter options.

To avoid confusion, Page is referred to pages in mini program.\n1. File structure and path\nA Page consists of three parts: UI, Configuration and Logic.\nUI is described with WXML and WXSS, configuration is done with JSON, Logic is created with JS Script. All files for a Page must be put at the same directory, WXML and JS files are mandatory, JSON and WXSS files are optional.\nPath for a Page must be declared in the pages field in app.json, otherwise these pages will not be injected. \nSay we have two Pages, pges/index/page and pages/other/other,  as following code snippet shows, default page is the first page declared in pages.\ncode snippet 3-7 page declaration in app.json\n{\n  \"pages\":[\n    \"pages/index/page\", // first page is the default page\n    \"pages/other/other\"\n  ]\n}\n\nTo make things simple, page.wxml, page.wxss, page.json and page.js are used to refer to some specific page's files.\n2. Page constructor Page()\nHost Environment provides a page constructor Page() to create a page. Page() must be called in page.js, like code snippet 3-8. Page() accepts an Object as parameters, fields are listed in table 3-4, data field can be used to intialize data for WXML template. onLoad(), onReady(), onShow(), onHide(), onUnload() are 5 lifecycle hooks of a Page.onPullDownRefresh(), onReachBottom(), onShareAppMessage(), onPageScroll() are user behavior callbacks, wich all will be explained later.\ncode snippet 3-8 Page constructor\nPage({\n  data: { text: \"This is page data.\" },\n  onLoad: function(options) { },\n  onReady: function() { },\n  onShow: function() { },\n  onHide: function() { },\n  onUnload: function() { },\n  onPullDownRefresh: function() { },\n  onReachBottom: function() { },\n  onShareAppMessage: function () { },\n  onPageScroll: function() { }\n})\n\ntable 3-4 page constructor paramters\n\n\n\nparameter\ntype\ndescription\n\n\n\n\ndata\nObject\ninitial data\n\n\nonLoad\nFunction\nwhen Page is loaded, it is called earlier than onShow or onReady\n\n\nonReady\nFunction\nwhen Page is rendered for the first time\n\n\nonShow\nFunction\nwhen Page is displayed, earlier than onReady\n\n\nonHide\nFunction\nwhen Page is hidden\n\n\nonUnload\nFunction\nwhen Page is unloaded\n\n\nonPullDownRefresh\nFunction\nwhen user pulls down to refresh\n\n\nonReachBottom\nFunction\nwhen scrolled to the bottom, threshold could be set\n\n\nonShareAppMessage\nFunction\nwhen user taps top-right button to share\n\n\nonPageScroll\nFunction\nwhen page scrolls\n\n\nother fields\nany\ncustom fields will be assigned to Page instance\n\n\n\n3. Page's Lifecygle and opening parameters\nWhen page is loaded for the first time, onLoad() will be triggered and triggered for only once until page is destroyed. The passed option could be used, which is explained later.\nWhen page is displayed, such as switched to from other pages, onShow() will be called.\nWhen page is rendered for the first time, onReady() is triggered, meaning page is ready to be manipulated from logic layer.\nonLoad() is triggered earlier than onShow(), onShow() is earlier than onReady().\nWhen page goes to background, such as wx.navigateTo() is called to redirect to another page, or bottom tabs are tapped, onHide() is called. \nWhen wx.redirectTo() or wx.navigateBack() is called, current page is destroyed, onUnload() is triggered.\nAs we can see, a Page's lifecycle is triggered by user interactions, so do avoid chaos, we should call lifecycle methods manually.\nLet's at last look at opening parameter, query. Suppose we have a page listing products, tapping the items leads to detail page. We of course cannot create pages for all products, rather we'd create a general detail page, pages/detail/detail, and pass id to the page. The id passed in query could be retrieved in option of onLoad().\ncode snippet 3-9 Page Constructor\n// pages/list/list.js\n// use navigateTo to go to detail page\nwx.navigateTo({ url: 'pages/detail/detail?id=1&other=abc' })\n\n// pages/detail/detail.js\nPage({\n  onLoad: function(option) {\n    console.log(option.id)\n    console.log(option.other)\n  }\n})\n\nA page's URL is the opening path. Similar to URLs of web pages, it consists of path and query, concatenated with ?. Paramter in query is of format: key=value. option passed to onLoad()is an Object, parsed from URL's query. Just the same as web pages' URLs, special characters(&, ? and Chinese character .etc) in values should be UrlEncoded.\n4. Page's Data\nChapter 3.1.4 explains the basics of how mini program renders, pages are described by WXML, and WXML can be binded to dynamic data passed from logic layer. \"Data\" here actually is the data field in Page constructor.\ncode snippet 3-10 data passed to Page constructor\n\n{{text}}\n{{array[0].msg}}\n\n// page.js\nPage({\n  data: {\n    text: 'init data',\n    array: [{msg: '1'}, {msg: '2'}]\n  }\n})\n\nPage has setData method, it could be used to update view, by passing data to rendering layer. Because rendering & logic layers are separate in mini programs, data passing in async, \nthat's why the second parameter of setData is a callback, which is called after view is re-rendered.\nsetData is called as setData(data, callback), data is an Object made up of multiple key:value pairs.\ncode snippet 3-11 use setData to update data\n// page.js\nPage({\n  onLoad: function(){\n    this.setData({\n      text: 'change data'\n    }, function(){\n      // this function is called after view is re-rendered\n    })\n  }\n})\n\nThere are some things to bring attention to:\n\nModify data by setting this.data will not trigger UI refresh, and causing data inconsistency\nBecause setData() passes data between process, for performance reasons, keep data under 1024kB\nDon't set any value to undefined, otherwise unexpected bugs may happen\n\n5. User Interactions\nMini Program's host provides 4 page-related user interaction callback:\n\nonPullDownRefresh(), triggered when user pulls down to refresh, to use this enablePullDownRefresh in app.json must be set to true. When callback is done, wx.stopPullDownRefresh could be used to stop.\n\nonRechBottom(), triggered when page is scrolled to the bottom, to use this onReachBottomDistance in page.json must be intialized. The event is triggered only once during the period when the scroll position is down below the threshold set.\n\nonShareAppMessage(), the \"Share\" button at top right is displayed only when this method is declared. This method should return an Object, containing title and path, which are used to share.\n\n\ncode snippet 3-13 use onShareAppMessage to custom share message\n// page.js\nPage({\nonShareAppMessage: function () {\n return {\n   title: 'title to share',\n   path: '/page/user?id=123'\n }\n}\n})\n\n6. Page redirecting and Router\nA mini program can own multiple pages, wx.navigateTo could be used to push a new page in, as Figure 3-6 shows, after calling wx.navigateTo for two times, page count grows to 3, we call this a Page Stack.\n\nFigure 3-6 Page Stack ater using wx.navigateTo for 2 times\nTo make it simple, [pageA, pageB, pageC] is used to describe page stack, pageA is at the bottom, pageC is at the top and also the page users see. Attention that currently this page stack can have up to 10 pages, which means you cannnot push more pages in after that. Now let's explain some APIs related to navigation.\nUse wx.navigateTo({url:'pageD'}) to push pageD into current stack, and it becomes [pageA, pageB, pageC, pageD].\nUse wx.navigateBack() to pop the top page from stack, now it is [pageA, pageB, pageC].\nUse wx.redirectTo({url: 'pageE'}) to replace current page to pageE, now it becomes [pageA, pageB, pageE]. When it reaches to 10 pages, you cannot push more pages in, this is where redirectTo is useful.\nMini Program offers native Tabbar, tabBar in app.json is used to configure this(Please refer to Tabbar official document for more details).\ncode snippet 3-14 bottom tab in app.json\n{\n  \"tabBar\": {\n    \"list\": [\n      { \"text\": \"Tab1\", \"pagePath\": \"pageA\" },\n      { \"text\": \"Tab2\", \"pagePath\": \"pageF\" },\n      { \"text\": \"Tab3\", \"pagePath\": \"pageG\" }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nIf we do wx.switchTab({ url: 'pageF' }) in previous page stack example, the stack will be cleared, all pages except pageA which is declared as Tabbar page are destroyed, then switch to the tab where pageF is in, page stack becomes [pageF]. If tap Tab1 to return to pageA, onLoad in pageA will not be triggered, since the page is not destroyed.\nBy the way, wx.navigateTo and wx.redirectTo could only be used to open non-TabBar page, wx.switchTab is only for Tabbar pages. \nWe can also use wx.reLaunch({ url: 'pageH'}) to restart mini programs and open pageH, now the page stack is [pageH]. Following table lists all the navigating methods and their relations to lifecycle hooks.\nTable 3-5 navigating methods and relations to lifecycle hooks\n\n\n\nnavigating method\nwhen triggered\nlifecycle hook(before)\nlifecycle hook(after) \n\n\n\n\ninitializing\nwhen first page is opened\n\nonLoad, onShow\n\n\nopen new page\nAPI wx.navigateTo\nonHide\nonLoad, onShow\n\n\npage redirect\nAPI wx.redirectTo\nonUnload\nonLoad, onShow\n\n\npage back\nAPI wx.navigateBack\nonUnload\nonShow\n\n\nTab\npage switch, API wx.switchTab\nrefer to Table 3-6\nrefer to 3-6\n\n\nrestart\nAPI wx.reLaunch\nonUnload\nonLoad, onShow\n\n\n\nTab pages' lifecycles(A and B are Tabbar pages, C is page opened from A, D is opened from C) are as follow table, attention that Tabbar pages are not destroyed after being initialized.\nTable 3 Routing and relations to lifecycles\n\n\n\npage before\npage after\nlifecycle hook triggered\n\n\n\n\nA\nA\n-\n\n\nA\nB\nA.onHide(), B.onLoad(), B.onShow()\n\n\nA\nB (opened again)\nA.onHide(), B.onShow()\n\n\nC\nA\nC.onUnload(), A.onShow()\n\n\nC\nB\nC.onUnload(), B.onLoad(), B.onShow()\n\n\nD\nB\nD.onUnload(), C.onUnload(), B.onLoad(), B.onShow()\n\n\nD(from sharing message)\nA\nD.onUnload(), A.onLoad(), A.onShow()\n\n\nD(from sharing message)\nB\nD.onUnload(), B.onLoad(), B.onShow()\n\n\n\n"},"chapter-3/3.3 Component.html":{"url":"chapter-3/3.3 Component.html","title":"3.3 Component","keywords":"","body":"3.3 Component\nOne Page in mini program can be divided into many basic part, which is Componnet.
