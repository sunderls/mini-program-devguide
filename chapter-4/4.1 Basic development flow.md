## 4.1 Basic development flow

Before starting, we need to have a clear vision and plan of the overall user experience of the app. Usually a wireframe graph is used to describe pages, interactions on them and redirects. Following figure is a wireframe for comment manage app.

Then we create markups by WXML + WXSS, recreating the element and interactions from design spec. At last we list up all the data needed in each page, chage the static declartions to dynamic variables in template, and fulfill the JS logic script.

Of course it is not mandatory to create mini programs like this, sometimes we may need to create JS logic first for uncertain UI design. There are many ways to improve effectiveness, ususally it is decided according to the style of teams. Only common development flows are mentioned in this chapter.
