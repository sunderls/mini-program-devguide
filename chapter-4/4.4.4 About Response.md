## 4.4.4 About Response

When `wx.request` is called, server handles request and returns HTTP response, mini programs receives it and triggers success callback with an object as paramter, paramter is explained as follows.

*Table 4-2 paramter of success callback*

paramter | type | description
---------|------|----------
data | Object/String | response
statusCode | Number | HTTP status
header | Object | HTTP response header

When response is received, success callback is always triggered no matter what HTTP status is, so you should check the status code by yourself.

The type of paramter:`data` passed to success callback is decided by `header['content-type']`, default `header['content-type']` is `application/json` so respose data is first JSON parsed before success callback is triggered. If parsing succeeds, the parsing result is passed to callbacks, in other cases `data` is the raw response in type of String.
