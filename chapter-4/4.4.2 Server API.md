# 4.4.2 About Server API

`url` is the API to request, mini programs' requests must be https, so developers must provide https service, and the domain must be configured in admin page. If mini programs in production mode calls API on domains outside configuration, error will be thrown in console.

For web development, usually a differnt domain is used for development phase. To make it easy to develop, domains event not configured could be accessed in Mini Program DevTool or development/beta version of your app.

Since mini program is being updated all the time, there is a period that some users may use old verion of mini program even the new app is released. So API version control should be considerd. Say the previous `getinfo` API returns `{ "username": "zhangsan","sex": "man" }`, in new version of API `sex` in response is changed into `0 or 1`, to keep older version App work, rather `sex` should be kept that way and `sexNumber` be added.
