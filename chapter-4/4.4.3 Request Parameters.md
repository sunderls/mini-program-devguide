## 4.4.3 Request Parameters

In `wx.request`, query paramter in url or `data` field could be used to pass data to server. For example, to get info of user of id:1, we pass current version of mini program to server in favor of compatibility, two ways of passing it are as follows:

*code snippet 4-8 wx.request*

```js
// pass data through url
wx.request({
  url:'https://test.com/getinfo?id=1&version=1.0.0',
  success: function(res) {
    console.log(res) // response
  }
})

// pass data through data
wx.request({
  url: 'https://test.com/getinfo',
  data: { id:1, version:'1.0.0' },
  success: function(res) {
    console.log(res) // response
  }
})
```

Above two methods are basically the same, but attention that length of a url is max to 1024 bytes, also paramters must be urlEncoded. When length is longer than 1024, it is necessary to pass `data` through POST. Considering this `data` is always a better option.

Let's look at the case of POST, not all request paramters are with the form of `key=value`, sometimes much more complicated data structure is used and JSON is easier to use. If we set `content-type` to `application/json` in `header`, `data` in request params is the JSON string, as following example shows.

*code snippet 4-9 wx.erquest use json in POST request*

```js
// request data {"a":{"b":[1,2,3],"c":{"d":"test"}}}
wx.request({
  url: 'https://test.com/postdata',
  method: 'POST',
  header: { 'content-type': 'application/json'},
  data: {
    a: {
      b: [1, 2, 3],
      c: { d: "test" }
    }
  },

  success: function(res) {
    console.log(res) // response
  }
})
```
