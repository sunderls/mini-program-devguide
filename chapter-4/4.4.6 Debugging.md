## 4.4.6 Debugging

If request couldn't be made or response is not received, we can debug in following steps:

1. check cellular or wifi network
2. check the version of mini program, development and beta version apps do not validate urls
3. check whether HTTPS certificate is valid, minimum version of TLS is 1.2 and you can get this info by entering `showRequestInfo()` in console.
4. don't use ip address for you API domain, don't use port number other than default, make sure it is ICP registered.
5. check timeout in `app.json`, if it is too short, request fails before response comes
6. check whether API request is redirected(302) to other domain, this kind of redirecting is treated as new API request in mini program so it may be blocked.
