## 4.3.3 Page Scrolling

Content overflow is inevitable in mobile devices, page srolling is a common solution for this.

To enable users to refresh current page more quickly, usually **pull down to refresh** is supported in mini programs, as following figure shows.

Pull down to refresh is built in the host environment, developers only need to configure it. When users pulls down and triggers the "refresh", `onPullDownRefresh()` in Page constructor is called, developers can now refetch data and rerender, as following code.

*code snippet 4-5 pulls down to refresh*
```json
//page.json
{"enablePullDownRefresh": true }
```

```js
//page.js
Page({
  onPullDownRefresh: function() {
    // users trigger pulls down to refresh
    // refresh data and rerender
    // wx.stopPullDownRefresh() // stop current refreshing
  }
})
```

Many shopping mini programs show a product list page, appending more products when users scroll to the page end. This is also built-in interaction.

**code snippet 4-6 onReachBottom**
```json
//page.json

// when distance from screen bottom to page bottom is less than onReachBottomDistance, onReachBottom is called
{"onReachBottomDistance": 100 }
```

```js
//page.js

Page({
  onReachBottom: function() {
    // when distance to page bottom is less than 100 pixels
    // this will be called
  }
})
```

Of course sometimes we don't want the whole page to be scrolled, rather a part of it is preferred. In this case, `scroll-view` could be used, `scroll-x` and `scroll-y` could be used to determine scrolling horizontally or vertically, it also provides many callbacks. Details could be found at the official document.
