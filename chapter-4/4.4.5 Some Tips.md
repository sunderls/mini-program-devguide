## 4.4.4 About Response

### 1. Set timeout

When a HTTPS request is sent, network errors or server problems may occur and response is not returned even after some certain period of time, this period of time is called `timeout`. Timeout in mini program is default to 60 seconds, in most cases we don't need a timeout of this long, maybe 3 seconds is long enough before some feedback is sent to user. Timeout could be set in `app.json`.

*code snippet 4-10 set timeout of `wx.request` in `app.json`*
```js
{
  "networkTimeout"： {
    "request"： 3000
  }
}
``` 

### 2. process before and after request

A common use case is like this: User taps a button, loading indicator is displayed, request is made. Then if response is received then next service logic is run, if not, a toast saying 'System error' is displayed, for both cases loading indicator is hidden. Here is an example:

*code snippet 4-11 wx.request example*
```js
var hasClick = false;
Page({
  tap: function() {
    if (hasClick) {
      return
    }
    hasClick = true
    wx.showLoading()
    wx.request({
      url: 'https://test.com/getinfo',
      method: 'POST',
      header: { 'content-type':'application/json' },
      data: { },
      success: function (res) {
        if (res.statusCode === 200) {
          console.log(res.data)// 服务器回包内容
        }
      },
      fail: function (res) {
        wx.showToast({ title: '系统错误' })
      },

      complete: function (res) {
        wx.hideLoading()
        hasClick = false
      }
    })
  }
})
```

`hasClock` is flag to prevent two taps in a very short time interval, request is only made if this flag is not on.
