# 1.1.2 Difference between Mini Program and Web App

Mini programs are developed by JavaScript, so it is often compared to web app. They are similar in many ways, for Front-End Developers, it is very easy to start a mini program. But there are some differences between them.

In a common web browser, there is only one Main Thread, so the page may freeze after running JavaScript for a long time. But in Mini Program, UI rendering and JavaScript are separated in different Process. Developers can use various DOM API exposed by browser, but not from mini program. In mini program, JavaScript is run in JSCore, which is not a browser environment, many popular libraries like jQuery, Zepto .etc couldn't be used. JSCore is also different from Node.js, some of the NPM modules couldn't work also.

Web Apps run on many different browsers. For PC there are  IE, Chrome and QQ Browser, for mobile web there are Safari, Chrome and various webviews in both iOS and Android. Mini Programs are run on WeChat Apps for iOS, Android and dev tool. These three environments are different.
