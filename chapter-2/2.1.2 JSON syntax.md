# 2.1.2 JSON syntax

Compared to XML, JSON is much more readable for human. It is a lightweight data exchange format, usually extra tool is not needed to read it.

JSON data is wrapped within `{}`, with key-value pairs.

It is similar to JSON Object literals , but different.

Key in JSON must be put within double quotes, this is often forgot by developer which leads to error.

Value in JSON must be one of following types:

1. Number: float or integer
2. String: put within double quotes
3. Boolean: true or false
4. Array: put within `[]`
5. Object: put within `{}`
5. Null

Any other format will lead to error, take undefined as an example:

One more thing to pay attention to is that comments are not supported in JSON. You will get an error if you put any in it.
