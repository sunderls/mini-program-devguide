# 2.3.2 Units

WXSS uses `rpx` (responsive pixel) as unit, making adaption to different devices easier. Look at following figure, same element will result in extra space around if using px to set width.

If changed to `rpx`, it will be :

When Mini Program is compiled, `rpx` will be calculated into `px`. The calculation is based on `width: 375 physical pixel`,  which means if width = 375px, `1rpx = 1px`. 

For example, iPhone6's device is 375px, 750 physical pixels, then `1rpx = 375 / 750 px = 0.5px`.

device | rpx to px (device width/ 750) | px to rpx (750 / device width)
-------|-------------|-----------
iPhone5 | 1rpx = 0.42px | 1px = 2.34rpx
iPhone6 | 1rpx = 0.5px | 1px = 2rpx
iPhone6 Plus | 1rpx = 0.552px | 1px = 1.81rpx
