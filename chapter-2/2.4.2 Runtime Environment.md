# 2.4.2 Runtime Environment

After knowing that JavaScript in Mini Program is different from in browser and NodeJS, developers must remember that runtime environment is also different.

Currently mini programs can be run at:

1. iOS (iOS9, iOS10, iOS11)
2. Android
3. mini program IDE (dev tool)

These three platforms have different ECMA standards. Currently there are 7 versions of ECMAScript, most developers use ECMAScript 5 and ECMAScript 6, but in Mini Program, runtime environment on iOS9 and iOS10 are not completely compatible to ECMAScript 6, some of the syntaxes and keywords are not supported or implemented differently, such as:

1. arrow function
2. let const
3. template literal
4. ...

So some codes will result in errors for old operating system. To help developers solve these problems, mini program IDE offers syntax transforming tools, which compiles ECMAScript 6 code into ECMAScript 5 to support all environments.

Developers should enable this feature in "project settings".
