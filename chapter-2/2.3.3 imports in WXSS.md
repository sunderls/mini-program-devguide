# 2.3.3 imports in WXSS

In CSS, you can import another css file like `@import url('./test_0.css')`.

This import will result at another request to `test_0.css`.

In Mini Program, this is also supported, like this:
```css
@import './test_0.wxss'
```

During compilation, these styles will be combined into one file, so no extra net request will happen.
