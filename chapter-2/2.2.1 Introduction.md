# 2.2.1 Introduction

File extension for WXML file is `.wxml`, open `pages/wxml/index.wxml` and you can find it similar to HTML. Developers knowing HTML should find it familiar.

```xml
<!--pages/wxml/index.wxml-->
<text>pages/wxml/index.wxml</text>
```

The basic syntax is:

```xml
<!-- comment here -->

<TagName propertyKey1="propertyValue1" propertyKey2="propertyValue2" ...> ...</TagName>
```

A valid WXML expression includes starting tag and closing tag, between them can be contents or other WXML expression. This is the same with HTML. What is different is that WXML strictly requires tag to be closed, otherwise compilation error will occur.

*code snippet 2-2 Compilation Error*
```bash
<text>hello world



<!--

compilation error since <text> is not closedï¼š

VM148:2 ./pages/wxml/index.wxml

 end tag missing, near text

> 1 | <text>hello world

    | ^

-->
```

Tags can own properties, which should be put at starting tag. Except for some special properties, properties are always expressed in format of `key="value"` . Attention that WXML is case sensitive, which means `class` and `Class` are different properties in WXML. Following example is a text tag.

*code snippet 2-3 WXML Tag*

```xml
<!--a simple text tag -->

<text>hello world</text>

<!-- a view containing text -->

<view>

  <text>hello world</text>

</view>
```

Following is an example of Image Tag with property.

*code snippet 2-4: an Image Tag with property*
```xml
<image class="userinfo-avatar" src="./image/a.png" ></image>
```
