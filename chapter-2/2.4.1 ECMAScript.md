# 2.4.1 ECMAScript

For most developers, ECMAScript is the same to JavaScript, but to be strict, they are not the same. ECMAScript is a language standardized with ECMA-262 spec, which is defined by ECMA International, JavaScript is an implementation of ECMAScript. Knowing this will help understanding why JavaScript in Mini Program is different from JavaScript in NodeJS.

ECMA-262 has several import sections:

1. syntax
2. types
3. expression
4. keyword
5. operator
6. object

JavaScript in Browser includes three parts:

JavaScript in browser is made up from ECMAScript, BOM(Browser Object Model) and DOM(Document Object Model), these are familiar to developers, they can be used to manipulate behaviors of browser, like changing URL, modifying UIs, collecting data .etc.

While JavaScript in NodeJS includes:

JavaScript in NodeJS is made up by ECMAScript, NPM and Native modules. NodeJS Developers are using NPM to manage JavaScript Modules, and native modules like FS, HTTP, OS to do extra things which are not in the language spec.

Here comes the JavaScript in Mini Program:

*Figure 2-17 JavaScript in Mini Program*

JavaScript in Mini Program consists of ECMAScript, Mini Program Framework and Mini Program API. Compare to browser, there is no BOM or DOM, so libraries like jQuery or Zepto couldn't run in Mini Program, also native functions and most NPM packages in NodeJS cannot be used.
