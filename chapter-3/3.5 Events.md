## 3.5 Events

### 3.5.1 What is an Event

User interace need to be interacted by users, for example, users may click some buttons or long press some areas, these actions should be notified to developers, and the new state should be reflected.

Sometimes the feedback is not triggered by users, such as the progress bar when video is being played, these changes should also be notified.

In mini programs, these components' updates triggered by users' interactions are defined as "events" passed from rendering layer to logic layer, as the following image shows:

![Figure 3-7 redering layer generates and passes events to logic layer](/static/3-7.png)
*Figure 3-7 redering layer generates and passes events to logic layer*

Here is a simple mini program.

*code snippet 3-18 exmaple of event handling*
```xml
<!-- page.wxml -->
<view id="tapTest" data-hi="WeChat" bindtap="tapName"> Click me! </view>

// page.js
   Page({
  tapName: function(event) {
    console.log(event)
  }
})

```

Event listener `tapName()` are attached to components through `bindtap` and it is declared in Page constructors. When users tap the view area, tap events are riggered, and `tapName()` will be called with the event as paremter.

### 3.5.2 Event Type and event Objects

Because different components have different state, here component-related events are not discussed, those events can be found at:  https://mp.weixin.qq.com/debug/wxadoc/dev/component/.

Common event types are listed here:

*Table 3-10 common event types*
type | condition
-----|--------
touchstart | finger touchs screen
touchmove | finger moves after touching
touchcancel | finger move is disrupted by income call, native modal, .etc
touchend | finger move ends
tap | finger leaves right after first touch
longpress | finger touches, and leaves after 350ms. If this event is triggered,  tap events will not occur
longtap | finger touches, and leaves after 350ms. (`longpress` is recommended to use)
transitionend | triggered after WXSS transition  or `wx.createAnimation`
animationstart | triggered before the first paint of WXSS animation
animationiteration | triggered after one frame of animation is rendered
animationend | triggered after one WXSS animation is done

The event passed to event handler has following properties.

*Table 3-11 event object properties*

property | type | description
---------|-------|--------
type | String | event type
timeStamp | Integer | time passed from page opened to event triggered(in miliseconds)
target | Object | property set of the component where event is triggered
currentTarget | Object | property set of current component
detail | Object | extra information
touches | Array | touch events, current active touch points
changedTouches | Array | touch events, currently changed touch points

Attention to the difference between `target` and `currentTarget`. `currentTarget` is the component where event listener is attached, and `target` the source component where event is triggered.

*code snippet 3-19 event object example*
```xml
<!-- page.wxml -->
<view id="outer" catchtap="handleTap">
  <view id="inner">click me</view>
</view>
```

```js
// page.js
Page({
  handleTap: function(evt) {
    // when click inner element
    // evt.target is inner view component
    // evt.currentTarget is outer view where handleTap is attached
    // evt.type == “tap”
    // evt.timeStamp == 1542
    // evt.detail == {x: 270, y: 63}
    // evt.touches == [{identifier: 0, pageX: 270, pageY: 63, clientX: 270, clientY: 63}]
    // evt.changedTouches == [{identifier: 0, pageX: 270, pageY: 63, clientX: 270, clientY: 63}]
  }
})
```

The detailed property paramters about `target` and `currentTarget` are listed here:

*Table 3-12 properties of target and currentTarget*

property | type | description
---------|------|----------
id | String | current component's id
tagName | String | current component's type
dataset | Object | data attributes of current component

*Table 3-3 peroperties of touch and changedTouches*
property | type | description
-------|------|----------
identifier | Number | id of touch point
pageX, pageY | Number | distance to top left corner. Top left corner is the origin point, horizontal direction as x-axis, vertical direction as Y-axis
clientX, clientY | Number | similar to above one, but distance is relative screen area (without the navigation bar)


### 3.5.3 Event binding, bubbling and capturing

Event binding is done in the same format as `key="value"`.

1. key should start with `bind` or `catch`, followed by event type, such as `bindtap`, `catchtouchstart`. From version 1.5.0, semicolon could be inserted , like `bind:tap`, `catch:touchstart`, they are the same. You can also `capture-` at the beginning to handle events as capuring phase. value is String, which is the method name defined in Page constructor, error occurs if method is not defined. `bind` means bubbling phase, and `capture-bind` means capturing phase, the order is :

![Figure 3-8 bubbling and capuring phase](/static/3-8.png)
*Figure 3-8 bubbling and capuring phase*

In the following example, tapping inner view will call `handleTap1`, `handleTap2`, `handleTap3` and `handleWTap4` in the right order.

*code snippet 3-20 use capture to set phase*
```xml
<view id="outer" bind:tap="handleTap4" capture-bind:tap="handleTap1">
  outer view
  <view id="inner" bind:tap="handleTap3" capture-bind:tap="handleTap2">
    inner view
  </view>
</view>
```

`bind` will not stop event bubbling, `catch` is used to do that. If change `capture-bind:tap="handleTap1"` to `capture-catch:tap="handleTap1"`, tapping inner view will only trigger `handleATap1`, becase `catch` stops the bubbling.

*code snippet 3-21 event capturing and bubbling*
```xml
<view id="outer" bind:tap="handleTap4" capture-catch:tap="handleTap1">
  outer view
  <view id="inner" bind:tap="handleTap3" capture-bind:tap="handleTap2">
    inner view
  </view>
</view>
```

Attention that all other events(except above ones) are default to non-bubbling ones, unless special notice is addressed, such as `submit` in `<form/>`, `input` in `<input/>`, `scroll` in `<scroll-view/>`.
