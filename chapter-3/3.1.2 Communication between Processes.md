# 3.1.2 Communication between Processes

Mini Program uses 2 processes to handle rendering and logic: *WebView* is for rendering, *JSCore* is for JS scripts. A Mini Program may have many pages, so there may exist multiple WebView, communication between these 2 processes is through WeChat Native Client, the API calling in logic layer is also proxied in Native.
