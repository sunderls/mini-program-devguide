## 3.2.2 Page

A mini program can have multiple pages, each can own unique features. To avoid confusion, Page is referred to pages in mini program.

### 1. File structure and path

A Page consists of three parts: UI, Configuration and Logic.
UI is described with WXML and WXSS, configuration is done with JSON, Logic is created with JS Script. All files for a Page must be put at the same directory, WXML and JS files are mandatory, JSON and WXSS files are optional.

Path for a Page must be declared in the `pages` field in `app.json`, otherwise these pages will not be injected. 
Say we have two Pages, `pges/index/page` and `pages/other/other`,  as following code snippet shows, default page is the first page declared in `pages`.

*code snippet 3-7 page declaration in app.json*
```json
{
  "pages":[
    "pages/index/page", // first page is the default page
    "pages/other/other"
  ]
}
```

To make things simple, `page.wxml`, `page.wxss`, `page.json` and `page.js` are used to refer to some specific page's files.

### 2. Page constructor `Page()`

Host Environment provides a page constructor `Page()` to create a page. `Page()` must be called in page.js, like code snippet 3-8. `Page()` accepts an Object as parameters, fields are listed in table 3-4, `data` field can be used to intialize data for WXML template. `onLoad()`, `onReady()`, `onShow()`, `onHide()`, `onUnload()` are 5 lifecycle hooks of a Page.`onPullDownRefresh()`, `onReachBottom()`, `onShareAppMessage()`, `onPageScroll()` are user behavior callbacks, wich all will be explained later.

*code snippet 3-8 Page constructor*
```js
Page({
  data: { text: "This is page data." },
  onLoad: function(options) { },
  onReady: function() { },
  onShow: function() { },
  onHide: function() { },
  onUnload: function() { },
  onPullDownRefresh: function() { },
  onReachBottom: function() { },
  onShareAppMessage: function () { },
  onPageScroll: function() { }
})
```

*table 3-4 page constructor paramters*

parameter | type | description
----------|------|--------
data | Object | initial data
onLoad | Function | when Page is loaded, it is called earlier than `onShow` or `onReady`
onReady | Function | when Page is rendered for the first time
onShow | Function | when Page is displayed, earlier than onReady
onHide | Function | when Page is hidden
onUnload | Function | when Page is unloaded
onPullDownRefresh | Function | when user pulls down to refresh
onReachBottom | Function | when scrolled to the bottom, threshold could be set
onShareAppMessage | Function |when user taps top-right button to share
onPageScroll | Function | when page scrolls
other fields | any | custom fields will be assigned to Page instance

### 3. Page's Lifecygle and opening parameters

When page is loaded for the first time, `onLoad()` will be triggered and triggered for only once until page is destroyed. The passed `option` could be used, which is explained later.

When page is displayed, such as switched to from other pages, `onShow()` will be called.

When page is rendered for the first time, `onReady()` is triggered, meaning page is ready to be manipulated from logic layer.

`onLoad()` is triggered earlier than `onShow()`, `onShow()` is earlier than `onReady()`.

When page goes to background, such as `wx.navigateTo()` is called to redirect to another page, or bottom tabs are tapped, `onHide()` is called. 

When `wx.redirectTo()` or `wx.navigateBack()` is called, current page is destroyed, `onUnload()` is triggered.

As we can see, a Page's lifecycle is triggered by user interactions, so do avoid chaos, we should call lifecycle methods manually.

Let's at last look at opening parameter, `query`. Suppose we have a page listing products, tapping the items leads to detail page. We of course cannot create pages for all products, rather we'd create a general detail page, `pages/detail/detail`, and pass `id` to the page. The `id` passed in `query` could be retrieved in `option` of `onLoad()`.

*code snippet 3-9 Page Constructor*
```js
// pages/list/list.js
// use navigateTo to go to detail page
wx.navigateTo({ url: 'pages/detail/detail?id=1&other=abc' })

// pages/detail/detail.js
Page({
  onLoad: function(option) {
    console.log(option.id)
    console.log(option.other)
  }
})
```

A page's URL is the opening path. Similar to URLs of web pages, it consists of path and query, concatenated with `?`. Paramter in query is of format: `key=value`. `option` passed to `onLoad()`is an Object, parsed from URL's query. Just the same as web pages' URLs, special characters(`&`, `?` and Chinese character .etc) in values should be UrlEncoded.

### 4. Page's Data

Chapter 3.1.4 explains the basics of how mini program renders, pages are described by WXML, and WXML can be binded to dynamic data passed from logic layer. "Data" here actually is the `data` field in Page constructor.

*code snippet 3-10 data passed to Page constructor*
```html
<!-- page.wxml -->
<view>{{text}}</view>
<view>{{array[0].msg}}</view>

// page.js
Page({
  data: {
    text: 'init data',
    array: [{msg: '1'}, {msg: '2'}]
  }
})
```

Page has `setData` method, it could be used to update view, by passing data to rendering layer. Because rendering & logic layers are separate in mini programs, data passing in async, 
that's why the second parameter of `setData` is a callback, which is called after view is re-rendered.

`setData` is called as `setData(data, callback)`, `data` is an Object made up of multiple `key:value` pairs.

*code snippet 3-11 use setData to update data*
```js
// page.js
Page({
  onLoad: function(){
    this.setData({
      text: 'change data'
    }, function(){
      // this function is called after view is re-rendered
    })
  }
})
```

There are some things to bring attention to:

1. Modify data by setting `this.data` will not trigger UI refresh, and causing data inconsistency
2. Because `setData()` passes data between process, for performance reasons, keep data under 1024kB
3. Don't set any value to `undefined`, otherwise unexpected bugs may happen

### 5. User Interactions
Mini Program's host provides 4 page-related user interaction callback:

1. `onPullDownRefresh()`, triggered when user pulls down to refresh, to use this `enablePullDownRefresh` in app.json must be set to `true`. When callback is done, `wx.stopPullDownRefresh` could be used to stop.

2. `onRechBottom()`, triggered when page is scrolled to the bottom, to use this `onReachBottomDistance` in page.json must be intialized. The event is triggered only once during the period when the scroll position is down below the threshold set.

3. `onShareAppMessage()`, the "Share" button at top right is displayed only when this method is declared. This method should return an Object, containing `title` and `path`, which are used to share.

*code snippet 3-13 use `onShareAppMessage` to custom share message*
```js
// page.js
Page({
onShareAppMessage: function () {
 return {
   title: 'title to share',
   path: '/page/user?id=123'
 }
}
})
```

### 6. Page redirecting and Router

A mini program can own multiple pages, `wx.navigateTo` could be used to push a new page in, as Figure 3-6 shows, after calling `wx.navigateTo` for two times, page count grows to 3, we call this a Page Stack.

![Figure 3-6 Page Stack ater using `wx.navigateTo` for 2 times](/static/3-6.png)
*Figure 3-6 Page Stack ater using `wx.navigateTo` for 2 times*

To make it simple, `[pageA, pageB, pageC]` is used to describe page stack, pageA is at the bottom, pageC is at the top and also the page users see. Attention that currently this page stack can have up to 10 pages, which means you cannnot push more pages in after that. Now let's explain some APIs related to navigation.

Use `wx.navigateTo({url:'pageD'})` to push `pageD` into current stack, and it becomes `[pageA, pageB, pageC, pageD]`.

Use `wx.navigateBack()` to pop the top page from stack, now it is `[pageA, pageB, pageC]`.

Use `wx.redirectTo({url: 'pageE'})` to replace current page to `pageE`, now it becomes `[pageA, pageB, pageE]`. When it reaches to 10 pages, you cannot push more pages in, this is where `redirectTo` is useful.

Mini Program offers native Tabbar, `tabBar` in `app.json` is used to configure this(Please refer to Tabbar official document for more details).

*code snippet 3-14 bottom tab in `app.json`*
```js
{
  "tabBar": {
    "list": [
      { "text": "Tab1", "pagePath": "pageA" },
      { "text": "Tab2", "pagePath": "pageF" },
      { "text": "Tab3", "pagePath": "pageG" }
    ]
  }
}
```

If we do `wx.switchTab({ url: 'pageF' })` in previous page stack example, the stack will be cleared, all pages except `pageA` which is declared as Tabbar page are destroyed, then switch to the tab where `pageF` is in, page stack becomes `[pageF]`. If tap `Tab1` to return to `pageA`, `onLoad` in `pageA` will not be triggered, since the page is not destroyed.

By the way, `wx.navigateTo` and `wx.redirectTo` could only be used to open non-TabBar page, `wx.switchTab` is only for Tabbar pages. 

We can also use `wx.reLaunch({ url: 'pageH'})` to restart mini programs and open `pageH`, now the page stack is `[pageH]`. Following table lists all the navigating methods and their relations to lifecycle hooks.

*Table 3-5 navigating methods and relations to lifecycle hooks*

navigating method| when triggered| lifecycle hook(before)| lifecycle hook(after) 
----------------|--------------|---------------|------------
initializing | when first page is opened | | `onLoad`, `onShow`
open new page | API `wx.navigateTo` | `onHide` | `onLoad`, `onShow`
page redirect | API `wx.redirectTo` | `onUnload` | `onLoad`, `onShow`
page back | API `wx.navigateBack` | `onUnload` | `onShow`
Tab | page switch, API `wx.switchTab` | refer to Table 3-6 | refer to 3-6
restart | API `wx.reLaunch` | `onUnload` | `onLoad`, `onShow`

Tab pages' lifecycles(`A` and `B` are Tabbar pages, `C` is page opened from `A`, `D` is opened from `C`) are as follow table, attention that Tabbar pages are not destroyed after being initialized.

*Table 3 Routing and relations to lifecycles*

page before | page after | lifecycle hook triggered
------------|------------|--------------------
A | A | -
A | B | `A.onHide()`, `B.onLoad()`, `B.onShow()`
A | B (opened again) | `A.onHide()`, `B.onShow()`
C | A | `C.onUnload()`, `A.onShow()`
C | B | `C.onUnload()`, `B.onLoad()`, `B.onShow()`
D | B | `D.onUnload()`, `C.onUnload()`, `B.onLoad()`, `B.onShow()`
D(from sharing message) | A | `D.onUnload()`, `A.onLoad()`, `A.onShow()`
D(from sharing message) | B | `D.onUnload()`, `B.onLoad()`, `B.onShow()`
