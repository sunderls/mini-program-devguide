# 3.2 Program and pages

Logically a mini program is a "program", made up of multiple "pages". The difference between "program" and "mini program" should be clarified, usually we need to store data when "program" enters and exits, or do something when page is displayed or hidden. It is very important to grasp the concept of "program" and "page", also the lifecycle of them.
