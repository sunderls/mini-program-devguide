# 3.1.3 Data-Driven

In UI development, programs hold many variables and manipulate UI elements. As UI gets more and more complicated, it becomes more and more difficult to handle. Usually UI view is strongly dependent to data variables, if there is some "method" to bind them together (UI updates itself when data changes), then we can save a lot of work.

This "method" is Data-Driven, here we explain the basics of how it works.

WXML structure is just like a DOM tree, which could be also described in a JS Object.

So WXML can be transformed into JS Objects first, and then render the DOM tree. Let's look at the previous "Hello World" example again.

When msg is changed into "Goodbye", the intermediate JS object is changed as well. Then the diff can be detected and patched to the DOM tree, this is called Data-Driven.
